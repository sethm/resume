* Work Experience

** Akamai Technologies
*** /Senior Software Engineer II/
*** November 2017 \ndash March 2022

- Designed and built a Rust application that reuses existing C++
  libraries and handles consuming over 10,000 Apache Kafka messages
  per second, providing near real-time monitoring of our network's
  provisioned state.

- Engineered a Kafka Streams data aggregation and event detection
  system that allows our customers to message their subscribers about
  potential threats, and allows our network to gracefully handle
  data center fail-over.

** Nominum, Inc. /(Acquired by Akamai)/
*** /Senior Staff Engineer/
*** September 2013 \ndash November 2017

- Designed a lock-free data structure to hold hundreds of thousands of
  URLs in our HTTP proxy, reducing memory footprint and improving
  response time.

- Built a customer reporting solution using HPE Vertica and InfluxDB
  capable of sustained ingest of thousands of rows per second.

- Designed and built a RADIUS and DHCP IP Address change tracking
  system capable of handling over 20,000 IP Address changes per
  second.

** Glyde Corporation
*** /Senior Software Engineer/
*** December 2007 \ndash July 2013

Innovative Consumer-to-Consumer marketplace.

- Designed and built a fraud detection and prevention system that
  reduced fraudulent activity by 80% and significantly increased
  customer satisfaction.

- Spearheaded integration of the Glyde Marketplace with PayPal (payment
  and withdrawal), and Twilio (SMS messaging).

- Implemented a cohort analysis system to analyze buying and selling
  patterns to improve business strategy decision making.

** Stanford University
*** /Software Engineer/
*** May 2004 \ndash December 2007

Software Engineer with the LOCKSS Program at Stanford University.
LOCKSS ("Lots Of Copies Keep Stuff Safe") is an Open Source,
distributed, peer-to-peer digital content preservation system used by
libraries world-wide to preserve digital journals.

- Architected and implemented major portions of the new LOCKSS
  peer-to-peer polling protocol (LCAP V3), resulting in a ten-fold
  improvement in content auditing and repair efficiency over the
  previous implementation.

- Created a complete testing environment in Python for stress and
  integration testing of the LOCKSS Network.

- Designed and built a dynamic Java plugin extension system for
  automatically finding and updating running LOCKSS systems with new
  functionality.

- Drove the creation of internal project management tools using Ruby
  on Rails, streamlining the ability to publish new content to the
  LOCKSS network.

* Personal Projects
*** AT&T 3B2/400 Simulator
*** [[https://loomcom.com/3b2/emulator.html]]

The 3B2 was a small, multi-user UNIX computer introduced in 1984 by
AT&T.  It was the primary porting platform for UNIX System V Release
3, but has since faded into obscurity. I built a full system simulator
to allow running unmodified UNIX SVR3 software for historical
preservation. This project involved a tremendous amount of reverse
engineering both hardware and software, as internals documentation was
unavailable. Additionally, WE32100 assembler and disassemblers had to
be written from scratch. It is released as part of the SIMH historical
computer simulation framework.

*** Symon 6502 Emulator
*** https://github.com/sethm/symon/

Symon is an 8-bit system emulator, including full emulation of the
6502 CPU, 6551 ACIA, 6522 PIA, 6525 CRT controller, RAM, and ROM. It
is released under the MIT Open Source license.

* Education

** Cornell University
*** 1992 \ndash 1995

Three years toward a BA in Linguistics.
